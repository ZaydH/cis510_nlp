\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:Conclusions}

This project empirically studied negative covariate shift's effects on 20~newsgroups classification.  The first key takeaway is the transfer learning's criticality when dealing with limited or biased labeled data.  Next, the most appropriate risk estimator will depend on the selection bias' exact characteristics; there is no ``one-size-fits-all'' solution.  This nuance is not discussed in Hsieh\etal's PUbN paper as they do not report results on the biased~PN risk estimator. `
