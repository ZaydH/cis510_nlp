\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:Conclusions}

This project empirically studied negative covariate shift's effects on 20~newsgroups classification.  The first key takeaway is that transfer learning's benefits compound when labeled training data is biased or limited.  Next, the most appropriate risk estimator will depend on the selection bias' exact characteristics; there is no ``one-size-fits-all'' solution.  This nuance is not discussed in Hsieh\etal's PUbN paper as they do not report biased~PN results.
