\section{20~newsgroups}\label{sec:20newsgroups}

First published by Lang in 1995, the ``20~newsgroups'' dataset is a collection of internet discussion board posts.  The original dataset consisted of 20,000~documents~\cite{20newsgroups} but was pruned to 18,828~documents in~2007 after duplicates and cross\-/posts were removed~\cite{Rennie:2007}.   This latest dataset has a predefined split of 11,314~train and 7,532~test documents.

Each document is assigned one of twenty possible labels depending on the original bulletin board where the document was posted.  Basic label frequency statistics are provided in Table~\ref{tab:20newsgroups}. The twenty document classes partition into seven super-classes -- referred to here as \textit{categories}.

In our experiments, the positive class is composed of the first four categories (alt., comp., misc., \&~rec.) while the remaining categories (sci., soc., \&~talk.) make up the negative class. Positive class prior probability~$\prior$ is approximately~0.56.
