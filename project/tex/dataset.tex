\section{20~newsgroups}\label{sec:20newsgroups}

First published by Lang in 1995, the ``20~newsgroups'' dataset is a collection of internet discussion board posts.  The original dataset consisted 20,000~documents~\cite{20newsgroups} but was pruned to 18,828 documents in 2007 after duplicates and cross\-/posts were removed~\cite{Rennie:2007}.   The latest version of the dataset has a predefined split of 11,314~train and 7,532~test documents.

Each document is assigned one of twenty possible labels depending on the original bulletin board where the document was posted.  Basic partition on each document category is provided in Table~\ref{tab:20newsgroups}.

The set of twenty document classes partition into seven super-classes.  In our experiments, the positive class is composed of the first four super-classes (alt., comp., misc., \&~rec.) while the remainder (sci., soc., \&~talk.) make up the negative class.  The positive class prior probability~($\prior$) is approximately~0.56.
